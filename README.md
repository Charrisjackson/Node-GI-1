#Hosted Weather app

Welcome to Carmani's hosted Weather app. Submit the destination for which you want to see the weather forecast, and the weather stack API will provide you with information about that specific location.

Navigate through the apps' different pages by using the page names included in the navbar.

At the bottom of the page, you will see my name, letting users know it was created by me, Carmani Harris-Jackson.

You can interact with this app on the User interface, by using the hosted link provided in my repository 'about' section.



#Note taking app

In this note-taking app, you will be able to read, edit, remove, add, save, and load notes configured inside of a JSON file, typically stored and separated in the form of an object with key-value pairs.

These JSON file objects contain the note title and it's body as properties, which are paired with their values, storing actual information about the titles and body (typically a random string created by the user that is interacting with the app).

You must use the command line to interact with the note-taking app.


#Language detection 


Language detection code allows you to input a string as an argument to the language detect function, which we receive access to after installing the language detect npm.


This npm can identify 52 human languages from text samples and return confidence scores for each language.

I have taken a screenshot of the results of a few text samples, to prove that this npm package works effectively.

This screenshot is located in the img folder, which is nested inside of the Language-Detection-Code folder.
